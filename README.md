# hxdGrid 
This is a variant of the original script which implements a different positioning method. The new implementation allows for elements that have different dimensions to be ordered in the layout. At this stage it is a roughly hacked approach and needs refining.



## Other Changes 
### Removed plain javascript animations. At a later stage there will be a shim script for IE9 (and other uncompatible browser) support
### Sorting has been removed. It will be reimplemented at a later stage.
### Addon modules have been removed
### Overall code cleanup(still in progress).A lot of the unneccesary functions have been removed
